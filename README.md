SLCLtraffic
===========

Set-ups up the Raspberry Pi as an access point and installs an incomplete program for controlling a model pelican crossing. The broadcast name is SLCLRPi01 and there is no security so anyone can easily log in with a computer, iPad, tablet or smartphone. This was written for a course for London KS3 computing teachers as an example exercise for starting to teach control using the RPi.
